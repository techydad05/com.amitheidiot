## The Story

Did you know that calling someone an "idiot" originally had nothing to do with intelligence? In ancient Athens, an "idiotes" (á¼°Î´Î¹ÏŽÏ„Î·Ï‚) was simply a private citizen who chose personal matters over participating in democracy. The Greeks believed civic engagement was so important that avoiding it was considered selfish and harmful to society.

Over centuries, the word evolved from describing civic disengagement to meaning "foolish person" - completely losing its original political context.
